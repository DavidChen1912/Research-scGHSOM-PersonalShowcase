## üìå My Contributions

### 1. Pipeline Integration & Optimization
Optimized and streamlined the **end-to-end single-cell clustering framework** of scGHSOM, transforming it into an automated analysis pipeline covering:
- Data input  
- Preprocessing  
- Clustering  
- Evaluation metrics  

**Key scripts**:  
- `programs/data_processing/format_ghsom_input_vector.py`  
- `programs/data_processing/get_ghsom_dim.py`  
- `programs/data_processing/save_cluster_with_cluster_label.py`  
- `programs/evaluation/clustering_scores.py`  
- `execute.py`  
- `grid_runner.py`  

---

### 2. Visualization Enhancement
Enhanced and extended visualization modules to improve interpretability of clustering results.  

**Key scripts**:  
- `programs/Visualize/cluster_feature_map.py`  
- `programs/Visualize/cluster_distribution_map.py`  
- `programs/Visualize/generate_treemap.py`  

---

### 3. Parameter Evaluation on CYTOF Data
Evaluated scGHSOM on CYTOF datasets across different parameter settings, recording outcomes and identifying performance patterns.

---

### 4. Benchmarking Against State-of-the-Art Methods
Benchmarked scGHSOM against recent high-performing clustering methods (e.g., **KMD**, **Costal**) and evaluated both **clustering accuracy** and **runtime efficiency**, providing insights for further optimization.
